# room-booking
A room booking system implemented using the same database framework as my invoicing system, Java, JavaFX, MySQL, that allows the user to book rooms based on their requirements, and allows admins to confirm bookings and manage and delete users.

As with the invoicing system, i'm holding back the database part, as its just a mysql install, although upon request i'm happy to provide it
